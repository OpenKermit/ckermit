# Porting C-Kermit 11 to the Victor 9000 / Sirius 1

Running notes for the serial-only Victor 9000 port. Branch: `victor9k-port`.

**Status:** all 24 modules of the minimal build compile clean for
`ia16-elf-gcc`. Nothing has been linked or run on hardware yet.

**Verdict:** this is a thin-platform port, not a rewrite. The blocker people
expect — a modern flat-memory codebase that cannot be squeezed into 64K — did
not materialise. The measured static data is **32,325 bytes, 49% of one 64K
DGROUP**, with the protocol engine untouched.

---

## 1. Why this works at all

C-Kermit was written in 1985 for machines smaller than this one and never
stopped being buildable on them. The tree still carries:

- `ckubs2.mak` — PDP-11 2.11BSD, 16-bit `int`, 64K I/D split, overlays.
- `#ifdef pdp11` blocks in `ckcker.h` that shrink windows and packet buffers.
- A `minix` target for 16-bit 8086.
- `V7MIN`, a "smallest possible build" configuration.

The protocol core is deliberately isolated in the `ckc*.c` files and talks to
the world through a documented function interface (`ttinc`, `ttoc`, `zopeni`,
`conoc`, ...). That boundary is the whole reason this port is cheap.

Two historical warnings are worth heeding, because they are about *data*, not
code: `ckubs2.mak` says C-Kermit 7.0 could no longer fit an interactive parser
on the PDP-11, and the makefile marks the 16-bit `minix` target "too big". Both
refer to a single 64K address space for code **and** data. We have far code
(medium model), so only the data half of that warning applies to us — and the
measurements in §9 say we clear it.

---

## 2. Target: one binary, two operating systems

`CKERMIT.EXE` is an **MS-DOS program that drives the Victor's serial hardware
directly.** It is launched from a DOS prompt, seizes the µPD7201 and the 8259's
serial IRQ for the duration of the run, and hands them back on exit.

It is designed to run unmodified on **both**:

- **Victor MS-DOS 3.1** — the machine's native OS.
- **FreeDOS for Victor** (`~/projects/myfreedos`) — the modern port.

That dual-target property is not aspirational. Everything Kermit touches on the
serial path is fixed by the Victor's wiring, not by OS convention:

| Resource | Address | Varies by OS? |
|---|---|---|
| µPD7201 MPSC, channel A | `0xE000:0040` data, `0xE000:0042` ctrl/RR0 | no — wiring |
| µPD7201 MPSC, channel B | `0xE000:0041` data, `0xE000:0043` ctrl/RR0 | no — wiring |
| 8253 Counter 0 — channel A baud | `0xE000:0020`, ctrl `0xE000:0023` | no — wiring |
| 8253 Counter 1 — channel B baud | `0xE000:0021` | no — wiring |
| 8253 Counter 2 — system tick | — | no — wiring |
| VIA2 (6522) clock enables | `0xE800:0041` PA0=chA, PA1=chB (LOW=internal) | no — wiring |
| 8259 PIC, memory-mapped | `0xE0000`–`0xE0001` | no |
| **Serial IRQ1 → IVT slot** | — | **YES — see below** |

**Exactly one thing differs between the two platforms: the interrupt vector.**

| Environment | PIC `ICW2` | IRQ1 (serial) lands on |
|---|---|---|
| Victor boot ROM | `0x20` | INT 21h–27h range (IRQ1 = INT 21h) |
| **Victor MS-DOS 3.1** (BIOS `IRQ.LST`) | `0x40` | **INT 41h** |
| **FreeDOS for Victor** (`kernel/victor_pic.asm`) | `0x08` | **INT 09h** |

So the driver must resolve its vector at startup rather than hardcoding it.
Detect the host with INT 21h AH=30h — FreeDOS reports OEM `0xFD` in BH — and
hook `0x09` or `0x41` accordingly. **Do not** probe by hooking both: under the
FreeDOS port INT 41h may already hold the fixed-disk parameter *table* pointer,
and writing a code vector over a data vector is an ugly way to fail.

Note that 8253 Counter 2, not Counter 0 or 1, is the system tick (FreeDOS routes
it IR2 → INT 0Ah). Reprogramming Counter 0 for 38400 therefore does **not**
disturb DOS timekeeping on either platform. `SET SPEED` is free to write the
divisor.

### The discipline that makes dual-target hold

Owning the serial hardware gets you half of it. The other half is a rule:

> **Everything that is not the serial port goes through INT 21h. No INT 10h,
> no INT 16h, no INT 14h, no direct screen memory, no BIOS data area.**

Victor MS-DOS 3.1 has no IBM-compatible BIOS video or keyboard. The FreeDOS
port supplies some. Targeting the intersection is what lets one binary run on
both, and it costs almost nothing here:

- **Console** — C-Kermit's entire console surface is seven small functions
  (`conoc`, `conol`, `coninc`, `conchk`, `congm`, `concb`, `conres`). All map
  onto INT 21h AH=06h/07h/08h/0Bh.
- **Files** — the DOS 2.0 handle API (`3Ch`/`3Dh`/`3Eh`/`3Fh`/`40h`/`42h`),
  directory search (`4Eh`/`4Fh`), cwd (`47h`/`3Bh`), mkdir/rmdir (`39h`/`3Ah`),
  file times (`57h`). All present in 3.1. Avoid long filenames (`71xx`) and
  anything DOS 4.0+.
- **INT 23h / INT 24h** — install Ctrl-Break and critical-error handlers, so a
  floppy error mid-transfer does not drop the user into "Abort, Retry, Fail"
  underneath a live protocol.

### Consequences of this decision

- The bare-metal newlib in `~/projects/newlibc/phase3_newlib` — its VFS, FAT
  driver, SASI block layer, crt0, and linker script — is **out of scope.** It is
  a fine piece of work and a possible later target, but it is not on the path to
  this milestone.
- The FreeDOS `INT 14h` driver (`kernel/victor_int14.asm`) is **not used** as an
  API. Its guts are reused as source (see §12), but Kermit does not call it:
  INT 14h AH=00h cannot express any speed above 9600, and it offers no
  "how many bytes are queued" call, which is exactly what `ttchk()` needs.

## 3. Toolchain and memory model

Built with `ia16-elf-gcc 6.3.0` in the `ia16-ubuntu-2` container.

`ia16-elf-gcc` supports only `-mcmodel=tiny|small|medium`. There is **no
compact, large, or huge model** — verified directly:

```
tiny OK   small OK   medium OK
compact  error: unrecognized command line option '-mcmodel=compact'
large    error: unrecognized ...
huge     error: unrecognized ...
```

So data pointers are always near, and **`.data` + `.bss` + heap + stack must
all fit in one 64K DGROUP**. `-mcmodel=medium` gives far code (multiple code
segments, ~1MB), which is why 296KB of text is not a problem.

OpenWatcom (`~/projects/open-watcom-v2`, `wcc`) *does* have compact/large/huge
and would allow far data. It was evaluated and **is not needed** — see §9a/§9b.

---

## 4. Build

```sh
make -f victor9k.mak          # build all objects
make -f victor9k.mak sizes    # DGROUP report + largest static objects
```

The entire feature configuration lives in `ckvictor.h`, force-included ahead of
every file with `-include ckvictor.h`. Nothing else in the tree includes it, so
it cannot affect any other platform. Keep new `-D` options *there*, next to the
comment explaining why they exist — not in the makefile.

---

## 5. Source files: in and out

### In (24 modules)

| Module | Role | text | data+bss |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `ckcmai.c` | main, initialization | 6480 | 1868 |
| `ckclib.c` | portable string/utility library | 13930 | 1526 |
| `ckcfns.c` | protocol support functions | 21600 | 12036 |
| `ckcfn2.c` | more protocol functions | 10685 | 170 |
| `ckcfn3.c` | packet buffer management | 7934 | 1141 |
| `ckcpro.c` | protocol state machine (from `ckcpro.w`) | 25318 | 1708 |
| `ckucmd.c` | command parser | 32749 | 2932 |
| `ckuusr.c` | command tables, top-level commands | 22170 | 3540 |
| `ckuus2.c` | help text (≈0 under `NOHELP`) | 467 | 14 |
| `ckuus3.c` | SET commands | 20355 | 1870 |
| `ckuus4.c` | more commands | 16344 | 492 |
| `ckuus5.c` | SHOW commands | 26312 | 2432 |
| `ckuus6.c` | more commands | 23453 | 1914 |
| `ckuus7.c` | more SET commands | 26051 | 1620 |
| `ckuusx.c` | screen / file-transfer display | 11014 | 350 |
| `ckuusy.c` | command-line arguments | 11799 | 274 |
| `ckutio.c` | **serial + console + timers** | 12318 | 3148 |
| `ckufio.c` | **file system** | 15760 | 2932 |
| `ckusig.c` | signal handling | 202 | 2 |
| `ckuxla.c` | charset translation — **0 bytes** under `NOCSETS` | 0 | 0 |
| `ckcuni.c` | Unicode — **0 bytes** under `NOUNICODE` | 38 | 2 |
| `ckcnet.c` | networking — ~0 under `NONET`, kept for symbols | 71 | 266 |
| `ckctel.c` | telnet — ~0 under `NONET`, kept for symbols | 38 | 4 |
| `ckvictor.c` | **Victor glue (new, the only non-upstream C file)** | 326 | 4 |

`ckcpro.c` is generated from `ckcpro.w` by `wart`, which is a *host* tool.
Build it with the host compiler (`cc -DSIGTYP=void -o wart ckwart.c`; the
`-DSIGTYP=void` avoids a `sig_t` clash with macOS `<sys/signal.h>`).

`ckuxla.c` and `ckcuni.c` compiling to literally zero bytes is the single
biggest win in the configuration — `ckcuni.c` alone is 770KB of source, almost
entirely translation tables.

### Out

| Module | Size | Why |
|---|---:|---|
| `ckcftp.c` | 558KB | FTP client |
| `ckcnet.c` bulk | 493KB | sockets, TCP/IP |
| `ckuath.c` | 410KB | Kerberos / authentication |
| `ck_ssl.c` | 174KB | SSL/TLS |
| `ck_crp.c` | 165KB | encryption |
| `ckctel.c` bulk | 290KB | telnet protocol |
| `ckudia.c` | 238KB | modem dialing + modem database |
| `ckupty.c` | 50KB | pseudo-terminals (needs `fork`) |
| `ckucon.c` / `ckucns.c` | 81/78KB | CONNECT — one needs `fork()`, the other `select()` on a tty; neither is usable. See §13. |
| `ckuscr.c` | 18KB | UUCP-style scripting |
| `ckcmdb.c` | 7KB | malloc debugging |

---

## 6. Platform abstraction boundaries

This is the map that makes the port cheap. Everything Victor-specific is
reachable from four files.

| Concern | Module | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Serial / TTY I/O | **`ckutio.c`** | `ttopen`, `ttclos`, `ttpkt`, `ttinc`, `ttinl`, `ttoc`, `ttol`, `ttsspd`, `ttflui`. POSIX termios — see §12. |
| Console / keyboard | **`ckutio.c`** | `coninc`, `conchk`, `conoc`, `conol`, `congm`, `concb`, `conres`. |
| Timers | **`ckutio.c`** | `rtimer`, `gtimer`, `ztime`. |
| File system | **`ckufio.c`** | `zopeni`, `zopeno`, `zinfill`, `zsoutx`, `zclose`, `zchki`, `zchdir`, directory walk. |
| Signals | `ckusig.c` + `ckcsig.h` | Tiny (202 bytes). |
| Networking | `ckcnet.c`, `ckctel.c` | Compiled out. |
| Terminal emulation / CONNECT | `ckucon.c`, `ckucns.c` | Excluded. |

**`ckutio.c` and `ckufio.c` are the port.** Everything above them is unmodified
upstream code. Everything below them is ours, and lives in `ckvictor.c` plus a
small newlib libgloss (§12).

---

## 7. Feature flags

All in `ckvictor.h`, grouped with rationale. Summary:

- **Networking:** `NONET NOTCPIP NOSSH NOFTP NOHTTP NOIKSD NORLOGIN NOURL NOBROWSER`
- **Charsets:** `NOCSETS NOUNICODE` ← biggest win
- **Process model:** `NOPTY NOPUSH NOJC NOREDIRECT`
- **Dialing:** `NODIAL MINIDIAL NOLOGDIAL`
- **Scripting/UI:** `NOSPL NOSCRIPT NOSEXP NOLEARN NOHELP NORECALL NOSETKEY NOKVERBS NOXMIT NOMSEND NOFRILLS NOCCTRAP`
- **Logging:** `NODEBUG NOTLOG NOSYSLOG NOCURSES NOTERMCAP NOESCSEQ`
- **Misc:** `NOREALPATH NOTIMEZONE NORANDOM NOUUCP NOWTMP NOPARSEN`

Deliberately **not** defined, because they are the point of the port:
`NOICP` (command parser), `NOXFER`, `NOSERVER`, `NOLOCAL`, `NOLP` (long
packets), `NOWINDOW` (sliding windows), `NORESEND` (restart), `NOSTREAMING`.

Note `V7MIN` exists upstream and looks tempting, but it implies `NOICP`, which
would remove the `C-Kermit>` prompt. Not usable here.

Streaming is **not** network-coupled — it is negotiated protocol behaviour in
`ckcfns.c`/`ckcpro.c` and survives `NONET` intact.

---

## 8. Upstream changes made

Five small, guarded edits. None changes behaviour on any other platform.

1. **`ckcdeb.h`** — wrapped the `sig_t` typedef in `#ifndef CK_NO_SIG_T`.
   newlib (and macOS) already define `sig_t`.
2. **`ckcker.h`** — wrapped `SCANFILEBUF` in `#ifndef`. It was hard-coded to
   49152 and is used as an **automatic array**, i.e. a 48K stack frame. Fatal
   on a 64K DGROUP; now `-DSCANFILEBUF=2048`.
3. **`ckcfns.c`** — wrapped `RQ_MAXTOK` in `#ifndef`. `rq_tok` is
   `RQ_MAXTOK * (CKMAXPATH+1)` and was the largest static object in the
   program at 9280 bytes; now 2064.
4. **`ckucmd.c`** — added a `VICTOR9K` branch so console input goes through
   `coninc()`/`conchk()` instead of reaching into glibc `FILE` internals
   (`stdin->_IO_read_ptr`), which do not exist in newlib.
5. **`ckufio.c`** — added a `VICTOR9K` branch to the directory-entry inode
   check, alongside the existing `Plan9` one. FAT has no inode.

Items 2 and 3 are worth offering upstream regardless of this port; both are
latent hazards on any small-memory target.

---

## 9. Memory budget

Measured, 24 modules, `-mcmodel=medium -Os`:

```
.text = 302,935 bytes    far code, medium model, ~1MB limit — not a concern
.data =  11,748 bytes
.bss  =  20,577 bytes
STATIC DGROUP = 32,325 of 65,536  (49%)
free for heap + stack + libc = 33,211 bytes
```

Largest static objects: `rq_tok` 2064, `optlist` 2050, `tbl` 1632,
`cmdtab` 1272, `numbuf` 1056, `cmdatebuf` 1028, `cmdstr` 1025, `mybuf` 1024.
Nothing else over 1KB.

Projected full budget:

| Item | Bytes |
|---|---:|
| Static data + bss | 32,325 |
| Packet buffers (`SBSIZ`+`RBSIZ`, malloc'd) | 8,192 |
| newlib stdio + bss | ~6,000 |
| Serial RX/TX rings (256 + 256) | 512 |
| Stack | ~8,000 |
| **Total** | **~55,000 of 65,536** |

**~10KB headroom.** Tight but real. This is why `ckvictor.h` sets `MAXSP`/
`MAXRP` to 1024 and `SBSIZ`/`RBSIZ` to 4096 rather than the `DYNAMIC` defaults
of 9024/9050, which would have cost 18KB in packet buffers alone.

If headroom is needed later, in order of payoff: cut `RQ_MAXTOK` further,
drop `SHOW` commands (`ckuus5.c`, 2432 bytes of data+bss), reduce `CKMAXPATH`.

### 16-bit portability audit

Measured under the Victor configuration, not assumed.

| Issue | Finding |
|---|---|
| `int` is 32 bits | Not assumed. Builds clean at `int` = 16 bits. |
| Objects > 64K | **None.** Largest static object is now `rq_tok` at 2064 bytes. |
| `malloc` > 64K | Avoided. `-DUNIX` makes `ckcdeb.h` define `DYNAMIC`, which turns `bigsbuf`/`bigrbuf` into malloc'd pointers. Without `DYNAMIC` they are `CHAR bigsbuf[SBSIZ+5]` with `SBSIZ = MAXSP*(MAXWS+1) = 2048*33 = 67584` — **over 64K, would not compile**. Do not remove `DYNAMIC`. |
| `BIGBUFOK` | **Never define it.** It asks for 290000-byte buffers. |
| Huge stack frames | `scanfile()`'s 48K automatic array — fixed, now 2088 bytes. |
| Pointer→int casts | Only 4 sites across the whole minimal build; none load-bearing. |
| Varargs | Not used by the protocol core. |
| Flat-address assumptions | None found in the modules that compile. |

Type sizes under this build: `int` 2, `long` 4, pointer 2 (near data) / 4 (far
code), `size_t` 2, `CK_OFF_T` = `off_t`.

`CK_OFF_T` is the file-offset type used for RESEND/REGET restart. On a 16-bit
target it resolves to newlib's `off_t` (`long`, 32-bit) — good for 2GB, far
beyond any Victor disk. **Verify** your newlib's `off_t` is `long` and not
`int`; if it is `int`, restart breaks above 32KB.

Open risks:

1. **`traverse()` in `ckufio.c` is recursive** (calls itself at lines 6295 and
   6563) with a **1066-byte stack frame**. Depth is directory nesting depth.
   Eight levels ≈ 8.5KB of a 64K DGROUP. This is the top recursion concern.
   Mitigate by keeping the stack generous, or by capping traversal depth.
   It also means `opendir` must support at least one open `DIR` per nesting
   level — see §12.
2. `shofea()` (`ckuus5.c`) has the largest frame at 2106 bytes — SHOW FEATURES.
   Harmless but worth knowing.
3. Path lengths: `CKMAXPATH` set to 128. Fine for FAT 8.3, and it feeds several
   table sizes, so do not raise it casually.

---

## 9a. Can we put the buffers and stack in their own segments?

Yes. Both toolchains can, and it was tested rather than assumed. The question
is what it costs and whether it is needed yet.

### What each toolchain supports

| Capability | `ia16-elf-gcc` | OpenWatcom `wcc` |
|---|---|---|
| Extra data segments | `__far` keyword; emits real `.fardata` sections (verified: a 20000-byte `__far` array landed in its own `.fardata` section) | `-mc` / `-ml` / `-mh`: **all** data pointers far (verified 4 bytes) |
| Automatic placement of big objects | none — every object must be annotated by hand | **`-zt<n>`**: objects ≥ n bytes move to `FAR_DATA` automatically. Verified: at `-zt32767` two 20000-byte arrays stayed in `_BSS`; at `-zt1000` a `FAR_DATA` segment appeared and they left DGROUP. |
| Source changes required | **yes**, at every pointer that touches the object | **none** |
| Single object > 64KB | no | yes with `-mh` (a 100,000-byte array compiled) |
| Stack in its own segment | `-mno-callee-assume-ss-data-segment` (documented "experimental") | `-zu` (SS != DGROUP) |

The stack case is more interesting than it first looks. In small/medium models
SS **must** equal DS, because a near pointer to a stack local is just a 16-bit
offset and gets dereferenced through DS. But in compact/large/huge, data
pointers are already far, so `&local` carries SS explicitly and stays valid
with SS != DGROUP. Verified: `-ml -zu` on a function passing a pointer to a
local produced a byte-identical object to `-ml` alone.

So **Watcom large model + `-zu` genuinely gives the stack its own 64K segment,
safely, with no source changes.** ia16-gcc cannot match that in medium model.

### Why we are not doing it yet

1. **There is no pressure.** Static DGROUP is 32,325 of 65,536 (49%), the
   packet pool is 8KB, and nothing anywhere is over 64KB. The largest single
   object is 2,064 bytes.
2. **The stack is not the problem.** Largest measured frame is 2,106 bytes and
   total stack need is ~8KB — about 12% of the budget.
3. **Far access is expensive under ia16-gcc specifically** — see §9b. Short
   version: gcc cannot keep a far buffer segment and DGROUP addressable at the
   same time, so in a loop that touches both buffers *and* globals it reloads
   `%ds` twice per iteration. That is the inner byte loop of the packet filler,
   and at 38400 on an 8088 with a 4-byte prefetch queue a `mov ds,` per
   iteration is not affordable.
4. **The `__far` blast radius is not local.** The pool is handed out as
   `s_pkt[i].pk_adr`, a plain `CHAR *`, and from there flows through 139+
   `CHAR *` sites across `ckcfns.c` / `ckcfn2.c` / `ckcfn3.c` / `ckcpro.c`.
   Annotating "just the buffers" means annotating the whole protocol engine —
   exactly the upstream divergence this port is trying to avoid.

### When it would be worth it

The scenario that genuinely needs far data is **large windows × long packets**.
`MAXWS 32` × `MAXSP 4096` is a 132KB packet pool — that cannot fit a single
DGROUP at any tuning. If that becomes the goal, the right move is **not**
`__far` annotation under ia16-gcc; it is switching to **OpenWatcom large model
with `-zt`**, where the buffers move out of DGROUP by compiler flag and the
source stays upstream.

The cost of that switch is real and should not be paid speculatively: Watcom
uses OMF objects and its own C library, so any newlib work does not carry over.
(Note that under the §2 architecture this is a *smaller* cost than it used to
be — we need far less from the C library now. See §12.)

---

## 9b. Can the hot code be co-located with the buffers?

The obvious idea: rather than paying for a far pointer on every access, put the
buffer-touching code in the same segment as the buffers, load the segment
register once, and let the inner loop run at near speed. This was measured.

**The idea is sound, and on x86 it hinges on one thing: there are four segment
registers, and the inner loop needs three of them live at once** — one for the
source buffer, one for the destination buffer, and one for the globals in
DGROUP. Whether it works comes down to whether the compiler will keep all
three resident across the loop.

### Buffers only: works, under either compiler

An encode-shaped loop over two `__far` buffers, written with **walking**
pointers (`*p++`) rather than indexing (`s[i]`):

```
                    loop insns   segment reloads in loop
enc_near                    8            0
enc_walk  (far, walking)    9            0      <- both lds/les hoisted to prologue
enc_idx   (far, indexed)   12            5      <- reload per access
```

gcc hoists both segment loads into the prologue and repoints `%ds` at the
destination buffer for the whole function, so those writes carry no prefix at
all. Cost is one `%es:` prefix on the source read: 1 byte, ~2 clocks on 8088.

**Indexing is what kills it, not farness.** An earlier "+34%" figure in this
document was measured on `enc_idx` and overstated the cost of far data in
general. Corrected here.

### Buffers plus globals: collapses under gcc

C-Kermit's real packet filler is not the toy above. `bgetpkt()` is 227 lines
and touches roughly 25 file-scope globals in its inner loop — `size`, `binary`,
`parity`, `rptflg`, `rptn`, `rptq`, `cxseen`, `what`, `myctlq`, `ffc`, `ccp`,
`ccu`, `fmask`, `keep`, `interrupted`, `data`, `first`, `crc16`, `crcta`,
`crctb`, ... That is normal for 1985-vintage C and it is not going to change.

Compiling that shape (far buffers + heavy global access) with ia16-gcc:

```
  1f:  lea    0x1(%si),%cx
  22:  mov    %es:(%si),%dl          <- source buffer, ES
  25:  mov    %ss:0x0,%ax            <- globals via SS override
  ...
  56:  mov    -0x2(%bp),%ds          <- %ds RELOADED inside the loop
  59:  mov    %al,(%bx)
  63:  mov    -0x2(%bp),%ds          <- and again
```

gcc used `%ss:` for the globals but had nowhere to keep the destination
buffer's segment resident, so it reloads `%ds` from a stack slot **twice per
iteration**. Loop body: ~33 instructions with 2 segment reloads, versus ~10 for
the near version. On an 8088 a `mov ds,` also flushes the prefetch queue. This
is strictly worse than not trying.

### Buffers plus globals: works under Watcom large model

Same source, `wcc -ml -zt1000 -oneatx`:

```
        mov  es,cx                       ; source segment  - loaded ONCE
        mov  ds,dx                       ; dest segment    - loaded ONCE
L$1:    mov  al, byte ptr es:-1[si]      ; source: 1 prefix byte
        mov  byte ptr [bx],23H           ; dest:   NO prefix (DS points at it)
        add  word ptr ss:_ffc,1          ; globals via SS: - 1 prefix, no reload
        cmp  word ptr ss:_rptflg,0
        inc  word ptr ss:_what
        cmp  word ptr ss:_cxseen,0
```

Three segments live simultaneously and **zero reloads in the loop body**:

| register | points at | cost per access |
|---|---|---|
| `DS` | destination buffer | none — no prefix |
| `ES` | source buffer | 1 prefix byte |
| `SS` | DGROUP (globals) | 1 prefix byte |

That works because Watcom pegs `SS` to DGROUP, so every global stays reachable
with a one-byte override while `DS` and `ES` are free to point at far buffers.

```
                       loop insns   segment reloads
ia16-gcc, far+globals         33          2  (mov ds, twice per iteration)
Watcom -ml, far+globals       26          0
```

So the answer to "can we co-locate?" is **yes — but it is Watcom that delivers
it, automatically, in large model, with no source changes.**

### Caveats before acting on this

- In Watcom large model **every** `char *` in C-Kermit becomes 4 bytes, not
  just the packet pointers. Pointer-heavy code outside the packet loop pays for
  that in both DGROUP occupancy and cycles.
- The alternative that would make co-location work under gcc — hoisting those
  ~25 globals into locals at function entry and writing them back at exit — is
  a rewrite of `bgetpkt()`/`getpkt()`/`decode()`, i.e. modifying the protocol
  engine. That is the thing this port exists to avoid.

**Net effect on the plan:** unchanged in the near term — at 49% DGROUP with a
4KB/4KB pool there is nothing to fix.

## 10. What is proven, and what is not

Being precise about this matters, because the two are easy to conflate.

### Proven on real Victor hardware

- **38400 bps transmit on µPD7201 channel A.** 8253 Counter 0 at divisor 2,
  VIA2 PA0 internal clock, polled TX. This is the FreeDOS boot debug console
  (`kernel/victor_serial_debug.asm`, `BAUD_DIV_38400 = 0x02`, built under
  `VICTORFAST=1`) and it has carried sustained kernel output during real
  hardware debugging sessions. The physical layer at 38400 — divisor, clock
  gating, chip init, 1488/1489 line drivers, cabling — is not in question.
  (MAME caps around 9600; 38400 is a real-hardware-only path.)
- **Bidirectional serial at 9600 on channel B**, polled, via the FreeDOS
  INT 14h driver — `CTTY COM2` drove a full shell session on real hardware.

### Written but never run on hardware

- **Interrupt-driven receive.** `kernel/victor_int14.asm` has the whole
  apparatus: per-channel `SERPORT` descriptors, 256-byte RX/TX rings, an IRQ1
  ISR with the MS-DOS 3.1 stack-switching pattern. But both channels ship with
  `irq_enabled = 0` and IRQ1 masked at the PIC. The note dated 2026-07-14 says
  the IRQ-buffered path produced no output and hung `ctty COM2`, and that
  re-enabling requires verifying the µPD7201 interrupt-acknowledge sequence
  (Reset Tx Int Pending `0x28` / RETI) on real hardware.

### Why the ISR is on the critical path for 38400 but not for the milestone

At 38400 8N1 a byte arrives every ~260µs. The µPD7201's receive FIFO is three
deep, so a polled reader has well under a millisecond of slack. That is fine
until Kermit writes a received packet to floppy or SASI — a multi-millisecond
blocking operation during which polled RX drops bytes on the floor.

But it only bites when the line is busy *while* Kermit is writing. With
window 1 and streaming off, the sender waits for an ACK per packet, so the disk
write happens on an idle line and **polled RX is correct at any speed** — just
slow. Windows and streaming are what make the ISR mandatory.

That gives a clean staging: **polled first for the milestone, ISR before the
speed and windowing work.** The ISR bring-up does not block getting a file
across the wire.

---

## 11. Serial driver: design

Lift the working parts of `kernel/victor_int14.asm` — the `SERPORT` descriptor
layout, the ring buffers, the ISR with its stack-switching prologue, the chip
init sequence — into `CKERMIT.EXE`. Do not call INT 14h at runtime.

Rationale:

- INT 14h AH=00h has three baud bits; the table in `victor_int14.asm` stops at
  index 7 = 9600. 38400 is divisor 2 and simply cannot be requested through the
  standard API.
- INT 14h has no "bytes queued" call. `ttchk()` needs exactly that, and
  `ttinl()` wants to pull a whole packet in one go rather than one byte per
  software interrupt.
- Owning the chip means Kermit does not depend on the host DOS's serial state —
  including the not-yet-root-caused DGROUP writer near `serport_b` that forced
  the `.have_port` descriptor self-repair hack.

Ownership protocol, on `SET LINE`:

1. Detect host DOS → resolve serial IVT slot (`0x41` or `0x09`, §2).
2. Save the old vector and the 8259 mask.
3. Mask IRQ1, reset the channel, program WR4/WR3/WR5/WR1, set the VIA clock
   enable bit, write the 8253 divisor.
4. Install our ISR, unmask IRQ1.

And the exact inverse on `ttclos()` / exit / Ctrl-Break / critical error. A
Kermit that leaves IRQ1 hooked after exiting will take the machine down.

Channel choice: **use channel A for Kermit** where possible, leaving channel B
for `CTTY COM2`. They share IRQ1, so the ISR must poll both RR0s; but only one
of the two owners can be Kermit at a time.

## 12. The layers below C-Kermit

`ckutio.c` and `ckufio.c` are stock Unix modules that compile clean for ia16 and
express everything in POSIX terms. Keep them. What has to be supplied is the
layer *underneath*, and under the §2 architecture that layer is small.

### Does the Unix TTY layer sit on newlib?

**Yes.** This was the main open question and the answer is unambiguous.

`ckutio.c` is 480KB of source and looked like the likeliest place to need a
Victor-specific rewrite. Measured:

| Configuration | Errors |
|---|---:|
| No termios variant selected (falls back to V7 `sgtty`) | 80 |
| `-DPOSIX`, `<sys/termios.h>` missing | 1 |
| `-DPOSIX` with a real `<sys/termios.h>` | **0** |

All 80 errors in the first row were `struct sgttyb`, `RAW`, `CBREAK`, `CRMOD`,
`TANDEM` — the ancient BSD interface, selected only because no termios macro
was defined. With `-DPOSIX` it uses termios and **compiles clean**.

`ckufio.c` needed exactly one change (the inode check, §8).

**Recommendation: keep both modules. Do not write a Victor platform module.**
The termios layer becomes a thin translator onto our own driver, not a call
into someone else's serial API:

| termios call | maps to |
|---|---|
| `cfsetospeed` / `cfsetispeed` | 8253 divisor write (76800 / baud) |
| `cfgetospeed` / `cfgetispeed` | read back the cached divisor |
| `tcsetattr` | µPD7201 WR3/WR4/WR5 — raw 8N1, no processing |
| `tcgetattr` | return the cached `struct termios` |
| `tcflush` | reset ring head/tail |
| `tcsendbreak` | WR5 send-break bit, timed |

and the file descriptor `ckutio.c` opens for the line reads and writes the ring
buffers directly.

Note the baud divisor is `76800 / baud`, so the table extends naturally past
9600: 19200 → 4, 38400 → 2, 57600 → 1. `ttsspd()` maps `SET SPEED` onto
`cfsetospeed()`, so high speeds come straight from that table.

If per-byte overhead through newlib's `read()` turns out to hurt at 38400, add a
`VICTOR9K` fast path in `ttinl()` only — that is one function, not a rewrite.

### libgloss: what newlib needs from us

A thin INT 21h shim. This replaces the entire bare-metal VFS/FAT/SASI stack
that a standalone target would have required.

| newlib hook | INT 21h |
|---|---|
| `_open` | `3Dh` open, `3Ch` create |
| `_close` | `3Eh` |
| `_read` / `_write` | `3Fh` / `40h` |
| `_lseek` | `42h` |
| `_stat` / `_fstat` | `4Eh` search, `57h` file times |
| `_unlink` | `41h` |
| `_rename` | `56h` |
| `_chdir` / `_getcwd` | `3Bh` / `47h` |
| `_sbrk` | DOS memory block from the PSP |
| `_exit` | `4Ch` |

Plus, from §2's console rule: `_read`/`_write` on fds 0–2 go to INT 21h
AH=06h/07h/08h/0Bh, never to BIOS.

### Still to supply beyond newlib

**Directory reading** — `opendir` / `readdir` / `closedir` over INT 21h
`4Eh`/`4Fh`, with a DTA per open `DIR`. The stock ia16 newlib does not provide
these. There is a reference implementation at
`~/projects/newlibc/phase3_newlib/libgloss/dirent.c` (over its VFS), but note
two defects to fix before reuse: `LIBGLOSS_MAX_DIRS` is **2**, and there is a
single shared static `current_entry`. `traverse()` in `ckufio.c` recurses and
holds one `DIR` per nesting level (§9), so a depth-3 directory walk fails and
concurrent walks corrupt each other.

**Filesystem odds and ends** — `access`, `chmod` (`43h`), `mkdir` (`39h`),
`rmdir` (`3Ah`), `utime` (`57h`), `sleep`.

**Already stubbed in `ckvictor.c`, safe to leave:** `fork` `execl` `execvp`
`wait` `getuid` `geteuid` `getgid` `getegid` `setuid` `setgid` `getpid`
`getppid` `getpgrp` `tcgetpgrp` `getlogin` `getpwnam` `getpwuid` `ttyname`
`ctermid` `alarm` `sysconf` `putenv` `readlink` `umask` `dup2`, plus the
symbols owned by excluded modules (`conect`, `connv`, `mdmtyp`, `nvlook`,
`ck_bracketaddr`).

Each stub is wrapped in `#ifndef VICTOR_HAVE_<name>`, so if the library already
provides one, define that macro. Build first, then add whichever macros the
linker reports as multiply defined — faster than auditing up front.

## 13. Milestone

```
CKERMIT
C-Kermit> set line com1
C-Kermit> set speed 38400
C-Kermit> send foo.bin
C-Kermit> receive
C-Kermit> server
```

Order of work:

1. **Restore the toolchain.** `ia16-elf-gcc` is not currently installed and the
   `ia16-ubuntu-2` container is not present. Nothing here is re-verifiable until
   it is back. This also closes the `off_t` question in two minutes.
2. **INT 21h libgloss → link `CKERMIT.EXE`.** File and console I/O only; no
   serial yet. Expect this to be the bulk of the remaining non-driver work.
3. **`C-Kermit>` prompt, on both DOSes.** Proves `ckucmd.c` + `coninc`/`conchk`
   and, critically, proves the INT 21h-only console discipline holds on Victor
   MS-DOS 3.1 as well as FreeDOS. No serial port involved. Watch the stack here
   — `docmd()` is 1152 bytes.
4. **7201 driver in `ckvictor.c`, polled, vector auto-detected.** `SET LINE` /
   `SET SPEED` / `SHOW COMMUNICATIONS`. Verify against a loopback plug before
   involving another machine.
5. **`SEND` one small binary file** at 9600 to a known-good Kermit, short
   packets, window 1, streaming off. This exercises the whole engine end to end
   and is the real milestone.
6. **`RECEIVE`, then `GET`, then `SERVER`** — still at 9600, still polled.
7. **Bring up the RX ISR and ring buffer** as its own task, standalone, on real
   hardware. Verify the µPD7201 interrupt-acknowledge sequence that
   `victor_int14.asm` flags as unproven. Instrument dropped-byte counts.
8. **Turn on long packets, then windows, then streaming**, one at a time,
   re-measuring free memory at each step.
9. **Push to 19200, then 38400.**

Only after all that is CONNECT worth considering — and it should be written
fresh as a small polling loop over `ttinc()`/`coninc()` in `ckvictor.c`, not
ported from `ckucon.c` (needs `fork()`) or `ckucns.c` (needs `select()`).

---

## 14. Compile log

Every module in §5 compiles with **zero errors** at `-mcmodel=medium -Os`.

Problems hit and resolved, in order:

| Problem | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `sig_t` conflicts with newlib | `CK_NO_SIG_T` guard |
| `struct zfnfp` incomplete | Self-inflicted: `-DZFNQFP` *suppresses* the struct, which lives inside `#ifndef ZFNQFP`. Let `-DUNIX` define it. |
| `ckucmd.c` uses `stdin->_IO_read_end` | `VICTOR9K` → `coninc`/`conchk` |
| `ckuusx.c` array "too large" | `SCANFILEBUF` 49152 → 2048 |
| `ckufio.c` `d_ino` missing | `VICTOR9K` branch; FAT has no inode |
| `ckufio.c` `getppid` conflict | newlib prototype; stub matches it now |
| `ckutio.c` 80 × `struct sgttyb` | `-DPOSIX` selects termios |
| `ckutio.c` `sys/termios.h` missing | must be supplied — see §12 |
| `ckvictor.c` prototype conflicts | Rewrote stubs as ANSI matching newlib |

---

## 15. Open questions

- Is newlib's `off_t` a `long`? If it is `int`, RESEND/REGET restart breaks
  above 32KB. (§9)
- Does the FreeDOS OEM byte (INT 21h AH=30h → BH) actually come back as `0xFD`
  on the Victor build? The whole dual-target vector detection rests on it. A
  fallback (`SET SERIAL-VECTOR` or a command-line switch) is cheap insurance.
- Does Victor MS-DOS 3.1 install its own handler on IRQ1 for an AUX/COM device?
  If so, Kermit must quiesce it, not just save and restore the vector.
- What does the µPD7201 interrupt-acknowledge sequence actually need? This is
  the one unproven hardware item (§10) and it gates 38400.
- Real stack size in the DOS environment. The `traverse()` recursion (§9) makes
  this matter more than it usually would.
- `SET LINE` naming: `COM1`/`COM2` for channels A/B is the obvious choice and
  matches the FreeDOS convention, but Kermit is talking to the chip directly, so
  the names are ours to define.
